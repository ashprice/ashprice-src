## 2018

- Wu, Shang-su (2018). <a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/as/article-pdf/58/4/704/79298/as_2018_58_4_704.pdf"><i>Taiwan's Defense under the Tsai Administration</i></a>. <i>Asian Survey</i>, 58 (4): pp. 704-725. Abstract: 'The Tsai Ing-wen administration of Taiwan has taken a different approach in various defense policies compared to its predecessor. Several military build-up projects are aimed at strengthening Taiwan's defense in the context of China's rising military power, but they are unlikely to significantly ameliorate the island's inferior military status, due to several vulnerabilities.'
