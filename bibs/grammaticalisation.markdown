# Grammaticalisation

- Bisang, W. and Malchukov, A. (eds.; 2017). <i>University and diversity in grammaticalization scenarios</i>. Language Science Press. A collection of papers that disucss issues of areal variation and language-specific aspects of grammaticalisation vis-Ã -vis universality.
    - Heine, B., Kuteva, T. and Narrog, H. <i>Back again to the future: How to account for directionality in grammatical change</i>. Argues that 'grammaticalization processes such as the ones described in this paper are ultimately due to the cognitive-communicative strategies that interlocutors recruit in order to create their discourse contributions', ie. that (in the examined case) 'it is neither the constructional format nor the inferential mechanisms or analogy that seem to provide a sufficient basis for explaining the "macro shift" from lexical source to the grammatical target of a future tense category,' but that there is 'some fixed asymmetric semantic relation between source concepts ... and the grammatical target concept'.
