Ever had a casual interest in linguistics, but didn't know where to start? Here are some good introductory works.

- Akmajian, A., Demers, R.A., Farmer, Ann K., Harnish, R.M. (2010). <i>Linguistics: An Introduction to Language and Communication</i>. MIT Press. If this is your <em>first</em> book about linguistics, familiarity with American English is best.
- Chomsky, N. (1965). <i>Aspects of the Theory of Syntax</i>. MIT Press. A foundational text; the first chapter, <i>Methodological Preliminaries</i> is a widely required text for beginning students in syntax.
