# Sponsorships and reviews

None of the content of this site will be previewed, edited, or approved by anyone else (except for occasional minor proofreading and consultation by individuals who lack a conflict of interest), including reviews, praise or recommendations. Nor will I accept any sponsorships for any of the content.

I will accept items for reviews and so on, but they are accepted on condition that they may not be reviewed, nor will they be given a specified date for review, nor will the review necessarily be positive. How I got the item in every case will be specified in the review.

# Affiliate links

If I do start doing regular reviews in the blog section, there may, however, be affiliated links. If there are, they will be for companies and products that I have honestly reviewed positively, and they will always be explicitly mentioned at the end of the page. All affiliate links will be decided after I have decided I like the product/the company's service enough, and not before.

# Post-editing

Non-blog sections of the site will receive regular updates and editing, and such will not be declared. Blog posts likewise will be edited, updated, and have wording changed. If I believe the changes are great enough I will make a new post and reference back to the older post. While the site is hosted on github, it is possible to diff the source if you are interested in changes, however, hosting may move or I may clear the history at my discretion.

# Advertisements

As you can see I host no advertisements whatsoever.

# Donations

I do not receive donations at this time, however, if I start putting up a consistent amount of content and I begin to attract some readers/viewers, I will consider doing so.
